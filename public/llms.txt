## Founder Story

Ryan York spent 15 years in education before realizing students struggled not from lack of intelligence, but from lack of stability. The chaos of poverty consumed cognitive energy needed for learning.

**The Scale of the Problem**:
- 2 billion people (1 in 4 humans) lack reliable access to clean water
- Women and girls spend 200 million hours daily collecting water
- 1,000+ children die daily from water-related diseases
- This happens on a planet that is 71% water

Clearwater is the first step in a mission to make water access universal.
