## The Problem

### The Challenge We're Solving

Ghana's informal water delivery market operates inefficiently, causing problems for all stakeholders:

#### For Drivers (Tanker Operators)

**Problem: Wasted Time & Fuel**

Drivers waste hours searching for depots with available water, burning fuel and losing income while their families wait.

**Specific Pain Points**:
- No visibility into which depots have water available
- Drive from depot to depot hoping to find water
- Burn expensive fuel searching
- Lose income during search time
- Families wait at home without water

#### For Customers (Homes and Businesses)

**Problem: Unreliable Delivery**

Homes and businesses can't plan around water delivery. Uncertain arrival times, opaque pricing, and unknown water quality leave families and businesses struggling.

**Specific Pain Points**:
- Cannot schedule deliveries in advance
- Don't know when water will arrive
- Pricing varies unpredictably
- No way to verify water source or quality
- Businesses can't plan operations around water availability
- Families struggle with uncertainty

#### For The System (Depots and Infrastructure)

**Problem: A Market Running on Hope**

The informal water market operates on phone calls, cash, and personal relationships. No one has the data needed to coordinate supply and demand efficiently.

**Specific Pain Points**:
- No centralized visibility into demand
- Cannot forecast needs accurately
- Cash-based transactions without tracking
- No operational data for decision-making
- Inefficient resource allocation
- Cannot identify bottlenecks or optimize

**Outcome**: Get water when you need it, from sources you trust.

**Outcome**: Turn operational data into better decisions.

## How It Works

### Simple. Digital. Transparent.

#### Step 1: Depots Join Network

- Receives requests from drivers

#### Step 2: Drivers Connect

Tanker operators use Clearwater to find available depots and optimize their routes.

**What Happens**:
- Driver checks app for depot availability
- System shows nearest depots with water
- Driver selects optimal route
- Picks up water efficiently

#### Step 3: Customers Order

Homes and businesses request delivery with transparent pricing and scheduling.

**What Happens**:
- Customer submits delivery request
- System shows available time slots
- Clear pricing displayed upfront
- Delivery scheduled and confirmed

#### Step 4: Everyone Wins

Efficient delivery. Verified quality. Complete transparency.

**Results**:
- Drivers save time and fuel costs
- Customers receive reliable service
- Depots gain operational insights
- System becomes more efficient over time

## Launch Timeline

### Coming to Accra — 2026

Clearwater is launching in Greater Accra in 2026.

#### Our Approach

**Methodical and Relationship-Driven**:

We're spending 2025 building relationships with depot owners, recruiting driver partners, and signing commercial clients to ensure the platform serves real needs from day one.

**Not Disruption — Coordination**:

This isn't about disruption—it's about coordination. We're organizing the existing informal market to work better for everyone: drivers save time and fuel, customers get reliable service, and depots gain the operational tools to manage their business more effectively.

#### Geographic Strategy

**Phase 1**: Greater Accra Region, Ghana (2026)
**Long-term Vision**: Scaling across Africa

We're starting in Accra where the need is greatest and infrastructure allows for rapid deployment, then expanding to other major African cities facing similar water delivery challenges.

## About the Founder

### Ryan York - Founder & CEO

#### Background

Clearwater is founded by Ryan York, a systems builder with 20 years of experience scaling complex operations—from education networks serving 10,000+ students to technology platforms used by 50,000+ people.

#### Why Water? Why Now?

After 15 years in education, Ryan kept running into a deeper barrier he couldn't solve from inside a classroom: students struggling not because they lacked intelligence, but because they lacked stability. The chaos of poverty consumed the cognitive energy that should have been available for learning.

#### The Global Water Crisis

**The Numbers**:
- **2 billion people** — one out of every four human beings — lack reliable access to clean water
- **200 million hours** spent every day by women and girls collecting water
- **1,000+ children** die every day from water-related diseases

**The Paradox**:
This happens on a planet that is 71% water.

**The Conclusion**:
It is an engineering absurdity. A systemic failure so massive that Ryan couldn't look away.

#### The Mission

Clearwater is the first step in a mission to make water access universal. We're building infrastructure, not just an app. We're here for the long haul.
